# #AWS_WhitePaper_Summary

- This document shows you how to use Amazon Rekognition and Amazon AppFlow to build a fully serverless content moderation pipeline for messages posted in a Slack channel. 

- The content moderation strategy identiﬁes images that violate sample chosen guidelines:
  - Images that contain themes of tobacco or alcohol.
  - Images that contain the following disallowed words:
     - medical
     - private

- Amazon Rekognition content moderation is a deep learning-based service that can detect inappropriate, or oﬀensive images & videos, making it easier to ﬁnd and remove such content at scale.
- It provides a detailed taxonomy of moderation categories. 
-  Such as Explicit Nudity, Suggestive, Violence, and Visually Disturbing.
-  You can now detect six new categories: Drugs, Tobacco, Alcohol, Gambling, Rude Gestures, and Hate Symbols.
