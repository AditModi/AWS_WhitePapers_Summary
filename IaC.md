# Infrastructure as code

- Infrastructure as Code has emerged as a best practice for automating the provisioning of infrastructure services. 
- This paper describes the benefits of Infrastructure as Code.
- And how to leverage the capabilities of AWS in this realm to support DevOps initiatives.

## Introduction to Infrastructure as Code

- Infrastructure management is a process associated with software engineering.
- Organizations have traditionally “racked and stacked” hardware, and then installed and configured operating systems and applications to support their technology needs. 
- Cloud computing takes advantage of virtualization to enable the on-demand provisioning of compute, network, and storage resources that constitute technology infrastructures.

- Infrastructure managers have often performed such provisioning manually. 
- The manual processes have certain disadvantages, including:
    
     - Higher cost because they require human capital that could otherwise go toward more important business needs.
     - Inconsistency due to human error, leading to deviations from configuration standards.
    
     - Lack of agility by limiting the speed at which your organization can release new versions of services in response to customer needs and market drivers.
     - Difficulty in attaining and maintaining compliance to corporate or industry standards due to the absence of repeatable processes.
