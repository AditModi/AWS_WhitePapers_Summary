## Best practices for adopting and designing IPv6-based networks on AWS

- Every node connected to an Internet Protocol (IP) network must have an IP address for communication purposes. 

- As the internet continues to grow, so does the need for IP addresses. 

- IPv6 is a version of the Internet Protocol that uses a larger address space than its predecessor, IPv4. 

- This whitepaper focuses on best practices for adopting and designing IPv6-based networks on AWS Cloud. 

- It covers IPv6 dual-stack networks for both internet-facing and private IPv6 networks use cases.


## Intro

- An increasing number of organizations operate dual-stack IPv4/IPv6 networks. 
- Carrier networks and ISPs were the first groups to start deploying IPv6 on their networks, with mobile networks leading the charge. 
- Adoption of IPv6 has been delayed, partly due to NAT with IPv4, which takes private IP addresses and turns them into public IP addresses.

- An increasing number of organizations are adopting IPv6 in their environments, driven by the public IPv4 space exhaustion, private IPv4 scarcity, especially within large-scale networks, and the need to provide connectivity to IPv6-only clients. 
- There is no onesize-fits-all approach with IPv6; however, there are best practices AWS customers can follow to plan and implement IPv6 into their existing cloud networks.
