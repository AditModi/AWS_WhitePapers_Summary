## Best practices for adopting and designing IPv6-based networks on AWS


- Every node connected to an Internet Protocol (IP) network must have an IP address for communication purposes. 

- As the internet continues to grow, so does the need for IP addresses. IPv6 is a version of the Internet Protocol that uses a larger address space than its predecessor, IPv4. 

- This whitepaper focuses on best practices for adopting and designing IPv6-based networks on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. 

- It covers IPv6 dual-stack networks for both internet-facing and private IPv6 networks use cases.
