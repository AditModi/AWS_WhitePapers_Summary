# AWS Key Management Service Best Practices


AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is a managed service that allows you to concentrate on the cryptographic needs of your applications while Amazon Web Services (AWS) manages availability, physical security, logical access control, and maintenance of the underlying infrastructure. 

Further, AWS KMS allows you to audit usage of your keys by providing logs of all API calls made on them to help you meet compliance and regulatory requirements.

Customers want to know how to effectively implement AWS KMS in their environment. 

This whitepaper discusses how to use AWS KMS for each capability described in the AWS Cloud Adoption Framework Security Perspective whitepaper, including the differences between the different types of customer master keys, using AWS KMS key policies to ensure least privilege, auditing the use of the keys, and listing some use cases that work to protect sensitive information within AWS.


### Identity and Access Management

The Identity and Access Management capability provides guidance on determining the controls for access management within AWS KMS to secure your infrastructure according to established best practices and internal policies.
