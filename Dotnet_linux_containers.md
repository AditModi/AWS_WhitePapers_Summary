# Modernize .NET Applications with Linux Containers

- Since the introduction of .NET Framework in 2002, more than six million developers have adopted the .NET programming ecosystem to build their applications.  
- In its initial form, .NET was built to run exclusively on the Windows operating system. 

- This resulted in large portfolios of applications running on .NET and Windows, particularly in the enterprise.
- Many organizations simultaneously want to move their VM-based deployments to containers, to predictably deploy their applications across environments, maximize the efficiency of their resource consumption, and introduce DevOps practices to automate their development lifecycle.

- Gartner predicts that by 2022, more than 75% of global organizations will be running containerized applications in production, up from less than 30% in 2020. 
- An IDC survey found that 45% of respondentsâ€™ application portfolio is running in containers today, and that is expected to increase to 60% in three years
- This paper walks through this use case of modernizing a .NET Framework application running on Windows VMs to .NET 5, and Linux containers running on Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) and AWS Fargate.
