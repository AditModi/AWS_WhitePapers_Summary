# Machine Learning Lens - AWS Well-Architected Framework 

- This document describes the Machine Learning Lens for the AWS Well-Architected Framework. The document includes common machine learning (ML) scenarios and identifies key elements to ensure that your workloads are architected according to best practices.

- While designing ML workloads, you should use applicable best practices and questions from the AWS Well-Architected Framework whitepaper.

- The Machine Learning Lens is based on five pillars: operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency, and cost optimization. AWS provides multiple core components for ML workloads that enable you to design robust architectures for your ML applications.

- There are two areas that you should evaluate when you build a machine learning workload:
 1. Machine Learning Stack 
 2. Phases of ML Workloads
