# Running Containerized Microservices on AWS

- This whitepaper is intended for architects and developers who want to run containerized applications at scale in production on Amazon Web Services (AWS). 
- This document provides guidance for application lifecycle management, security, and architectural software design patterns for container-based applications on AWS.

- It also discusses architectural best practices for adoption of containers on AWS, and how traditional software design patterns evolve in the context of containers. 

- It leverages Martin Fowlerâ€™s principles of microservices and map them to the twelve-factor app pattern and real-life considerations. 
- After reading this paper, you will have a starting point for building microservices using best practices and software design patterns.
