# Machine Learning Best Practices in Healthcare and Life Sciences

## An overview of security and good machine learning compliance practices using AWS

- This whitepaper describes how AWS approaches machine learning (ML) in a regulated environment and provides guidance on good ML practices using AWS products.

- This whitepaper takes into consideration the principles described in the Proposed <a href="https://www.fda.gov/files/medical%20devices/published/US-FDA-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning-Discussion-Paper.pdf"> Regulatory Framework </a> for Modifications to AI/ML-Based Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) discussion paper.

- This content has been developed based on experience with and feedback from AWS pharmaceutical and medical device customers, as well as software partners. 


### Life sciences at AWS

AI/ML in the life sciences industry fall under five main categories:


- Research and discovery — Use cases include molecular structure prediction, antibody binding affinity prediction, outcome prediction for patients with certain
biomarkers, patient data enrichment and search, the classification of tissue samples, and so on.


- Clinical development — Use cases include forecasting and optimization of trial timelines, optimization of inclusion/exclusion criteria and site selection, protocol document enrichment, and so on.


- Manufacturing and supply chain — Use cases include predictive maintenance of equipment, computer vision for effective line clearance, optimization of manufacturing process staging, vial inspection, and so on.


- Commercial — Use cases include predicting healthcare providers with relevant patient bases, identifying next best action for sales and marketing, annotation and management of existing promotional materials, and so on. 

- Post-market surveillance and patient support — Use cases include forecasting patient cost, automation of adverse event detection from social media or call centers, patient outcome prediction, and so on.
