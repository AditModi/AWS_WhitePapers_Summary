# MLOps: Operationalizing ML on AWS 

- In modern software development, continuous delivery (CD) principles have significantly improved the throughput of delivering software to production in a safe, continuous, and reliable way and helped to avoid big, disruptive, and error prone deployments. 

- Creating a process to operationalize ML systems enables organizations to leverage the new and endless opportunities of machine learning to optimize processes and products. 
- Using ML models in software development makes it difficult to achieve versioning, quality control, reliability, reproducibility, explainability, and audibility in that process.
- This happens because there are a higher number of: 
  1. changing artifacts to be managed. 
  2. In addition to the software code, such as the datasets, the machine learning models, and the parameters and hyperparameters used by such models.
  3. And the size and portability of such artifacts can be orders of magnitude higher than the software code.
